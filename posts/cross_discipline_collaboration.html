            These reflections are meant to capture the lessons I learned during my various collaborations with industry, government agencies, and research bodies.
            As part of the projects I completed during my years attending Macquarie University and the University of Western Australia.

            <h3 class="section__title">Keeping Everyone Engaged</h3>
          <p>
            Arguably the most challenging part of any project is keeping everyone engaged. 
            With some estimates putting only 13% of people engaged with a given project.
            I think it's unrealistic to expect members of our teams to work at 100% all the time.
            So what stragies can we employ to create an environment that makes it easier for all 
            members of the team to work together?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b><a href="https://hbr.org/2020/03/how-to-work-with-someone-whos-disengaged">The Harvard Buisness Review</a></b> 
            has some good articles and discource on the subject but I'll limit my thoughts here based 
            on these ideas and my own experiences working with teams in geoscience and software
            development teams. Getting the obvious out of the way running a sucessful team or project is about: <b>communication, 
            collaboration, and consensus derived compromise. </b>
            In this section I'll share a few simple examples of each.
          </p>

          <p> 
            <b>Communication</b> - We have all worked on projects or in organisations where no-one talks to each other. Silos, or isolated teams arise from
            a breakdown in communication and ultimately everyone suffers. Either efforts are duplicated, information is withheld, or 
            people just stop trying.
            It's frustrating to know that somewhere in a sharepoint is the exact file you need to finish that key project, but they other
            team just won't give you the access or permissions you need.
            Rarely will these silo's arise from malice, instead just poor communication, poor understanding of the vision or goal of the team/company. 
            Sprinkle in enough time and you'll see walls start to grow.
          </p>
          <p> 
            These boundaries established by poor communication thankfully can be broken down with good communication. Building bridges, collaborative meetings, and 
            prioritising helping other teams, cuts through these silos often quicker than they can be established. Driving this at a higher level is ensuring the teams all 
            have the right metrics, to drive positive change.
          </p>

          <p> 
            <b>Collaboration </b> - No team should feel like a one person act. The Boss factor is a great example but in short if your team only functions when one
            person is there, or worse they work better when one person isn't. It might be time to look at how you can level the playing field.
            Most of the time issues with collaboration don't arise as a matter of hard worker vs lazy worker. Everyone works differently and collaboration
            is based on respect. 
      
          </p>
          <p> 
            Look around your team and see the members as individuals not just skillsets. Their way of working may inform the tasks they're suited to as much as 
            their training. A slower paced worker, may just be more methodical and better suited to review tasks, where the frantic high pace member is well suited to hotfixes
            and monitoring emails, but doesn't have the patience for planning or admin. 
          </p>

          <p> 
            <b>Consensus Derived Compromise </b> - a vision your team doesn't agree on is one you will never reach. The role of the team lead is crucial here,
            as not only do you need to blanace the capacity of the team but you also need to limit the scope of your vision. A good or a bad leader is defined in this 
            judgement.       
          </p>
          <p> 
            A good team trusts each other and recognises the expertise and skills of their collegues. 
            A great team understands the vision of the project and is willing to sacrifice part of their values to achieve it.
            In the teams I worked with for the NGEA and FAA, what drove our sucess wasn't an individuals vision. 
            It was a blending of ideas, which we distilled into a clear goal, which we then all worked towards.
          </p>

          <p>
         
            Lets start by broadly categorising the types of skillsets we encounter
            in geoseince and software development and talk about what motivates these parties:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Data Scientists</b></li> 
                <ul>
                  <li>Lets face it everyone loves pattern recognition, but data scientists are obsessed.</li> 
                  <li>Often they have great statistically tools at their disposal and love a good challenge.</li> 
                  <li>They typically lack domain expertise, focusing more on the values rather than their meaning.</li> 
                  <li>While percieved as software devlopers by most geo's they may not focus on aspects of code quality and health such as testing.</li> 
                </ul>
                  
              <li><b>Geo Scientists</b></li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Everyone loves a good rock licker but geos are on an entirely different level.</li> 
                  <li>They're understanding of geological meaning and problems as well as how they manifest in their domain is critical.</li> 
                  <li>However they can only hold so much data in their head, and are time poor due to aspects of BAU.</li> 
                  <li>While a great source of domain knowledge, they are often hesitant to share it due to the high penalties associated with getting it wrong.</li> 
                </ul>
              <li><b>Software Engineers</b></li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Their code, an artform; their tests, passing; their systems, running without down time.</li> 
                  <li>They're understanding of newtwork security, deployment, release and development cycles are great.</li> 
                  <li>However they have little to no interest in the validity of what flows through their system, as long as it flows smoothly.</li> 
                  <li>Their priorities can easily cause conflicts with other contributors who don't understand the importance of the proceses they implement.</li> 
                </ul>
            </ul>
