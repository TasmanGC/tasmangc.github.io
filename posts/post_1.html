          <h3 class="section__title">Exploration Geoscience </h3>
          <p>
            In the exploration geoscience field, considerable effort is expended by field technicians, 
            Crew leaders, and geoscientists.
            To acquire process and interpret the signatures and traces of geological reality that lie 
            just below the surface.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Glimpses of reality; captured in assays, geophysical logs, and stereo nets.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason we brave harsh conditions, equipment failures, and the miasma of field life is because, at our core
            exploration geoscientists are <b>addicted to discovery</b>. The idea of being the boots on the ground when 
            the next Olympic Dam is pegged, or the first mine to successfully operate under deep cover. Such aspirations
            drive many a project geo, to late nights going over the data just one more time....
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Our biggest fear by extension is missing something.</b> Such ideals are well characterised by Author Malcom Knox, where
            he refers to many early exploration personalities of Australia as <b>"nearly men."</b> Forgotten to the passages of time, they drilled
            one to few holes, stopped the survey 1km short. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm proud to say our industry has diversifed much in the past few decades no longer just "nearly men" dominate the landscape.
            But something that hasn't changed, is no matter who you are, if you work in exploration, you don't want to miss anything. 
          </p>
          <section class="js-section">
            <h3 class="section__title">Knowledge Discovery</h3>
          <p>
            The process of knowledge discovery and generating insight,
            leads to sleepless nights pooring over tables and old reports <b> looking for something your predecessors missed.</b>
            Asking yourself the age old question. . . .
          </p>
          <p>
            What am <b>I</b> missing?
          </p>
          <p>
            Sadly the modern geoscientist is torn, between the floods of new data coming in, and the legacy dataset that they've been meaning to get around to.
            As the skillsets grow to accomidate this flood of data (with the average geo knowing their way around an excel macro,
            a taste for python, or an r script). These efforts while valuable and to be encouraged are rarely scalable.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            The scale of the data, the training of ML models, the validation and maintainence work required to keep it running, is out of scope for 0.2 FTE 
            their supportive manager is likely to give them.
            The other 0.8 FTE spent on the dreaded BAU (buisness as usual to the uninitiated) will always be the priority. 
            So sadly many of these projects will die on the laptop desktops of passionate people who 
            had to prepare for the next monthly handover presentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            So what's the answer? Hand the project over to the Data Science (DS) team and hope for the best? I say adamently NO! 
            The integration of geoscience knowledge in process of scaling and deploying these projects is crucial. 
            The process of Acceptance Test Plans, Data Reveiw, and model refinement should always integrate domain knowledge. 
            Otherwise the little voice in the geo's mind will never go away....
          </p>
          <p>
            What are <b>they</b> missing?
          </p>
          <p>
            If those with sign off, doubt the veracity of the DS team. Then you end up with a stale mate, 
            the geo refuses to give insight until he believes the DS team will listen. Where the DS team starts to view their SME 
            as a unreliable source, sometimes full of boundless knowledge and sometimes 
          </p>

          <p>
            Money lost, time lost, <b>discoveries</b> lost. . .
          </p>
          <section class="js-section">
            <h3 class="section__title">The Role of Data Science in Exploration</h3>
          <p>
            So we have been introduced into the mindset of the average exploration geoscientist.
            But what of the humble data-scientist, what is it they want? Starteling they want the exact same thing,
            they want to find something. A trend, a pattern, <b>a signal in the noise.</b> The only difference
            is they they care little of it's geological significance. A trend is a trend. . 
          </p>
          <p>
            These sentiments will ring true to any geo's that work with DS on a regular basis similar annecdotes. They will raise all the patterns they find,
            that arguably is their job. Some times the cause will be so gut wrenchingly obvious to the geo that they will, 
            dismiss the idea of DS all together. Sometimes however they raise something they discovered on chance, that can 
            light a spark in an exploration manger that prompts three more holes 'just in case'.
          </p>
          <p>
            They are a wealth of statistical techniques, machine learning expertise, and scalable programming.
